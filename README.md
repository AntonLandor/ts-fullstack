# Create T3 App

This is a simple typesafe fullstack application, using the [T3 Stack](https://create.t3.gg/) bootstrapped with `create-t3-app`. The purpose of this project is to explore the T3 Stack and React Server Components. The project is not built as a production ready application, so do not nitpick on the details. This is not how you should handle transactions. I've spent little time on this project, so there are many things that could be improved. This is by no means a showcase of my skills, but rather a playground for me to explore cool stuff.

It includes:

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org)
- [Prisma](https://prisma.io)
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com)
- [tRPC](https://trpc.io)
